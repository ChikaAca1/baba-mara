### Task 26: Payment Success/Failure Pages ✅

**Already completed** as part of Task 22 (success and cancel pages).

## Technical Implementation

### Payment Flow

```
User selects plan → POST /api/payment/create
    ↓
Create transaction (status: pending)
    ↓
Call Payten API → Get payment URL
    ↓
Redirect user to Payten gateway
    ↓
User completes payment
    ↓
Payten webhook → POST /api/payment/webhook
    ↓
Verify signature → Update transaction
    ↓
add_user_credits() → Update subscription (if applicable)
    ↓
Redirect to success page
```

### Database Integration

Uses existing `transactions` table from Phase 2:
- Transaction type: single, subscription, topup
- Status: pending, completed, failed, refunded
- Credit tracking
- Subscription management integration

**Database Functions Used:**
- `add_user_credits(user_id, credits)` - Add credits after payment
- `deduct_user_credits(user_id, credits)` - Remove credits for refunds

### Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid user session
2. **Webhook Signature**: HMAC-SHA256 verification prevents spoofing
3. **Transaction Ownership**: Users can only access their own transactions
4. **Error Logging**: All payment errors logged to database
5. **Guest Prevention**: Guest accounts cannot purchase (must create permanent account)

### Pricing & Economics

**Product Pricing:**
| Product | Price | Credits | Cost/Credit | Savings |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Single | $1.99 | 1 | $1.99 | - |
| Subscription | $9.99/mo | 12 | $0.83 | 58% |
| Top-Up | $9.99 | 10 | $1.00 | 50% |

**Cost Structure (per reading):**
```
AI Generation: $0.020
TTS Audio:     $0.004
Voice (opt):   $0.050
Storage:       $0.001
─────────────────────
Text:          $0.025
Voice:         $0.075
```

**Profit Margins:**
- Single: ~98% (text), ~96% (voice)
- Subscription: ~97% (text), ~91% (voice)
- Top-Up: ~97.5% (text), ~92.5% (voice)

**Monthly Revenue Estimate (1,000 users, 40/30/30 split):**
```
Revenue: $6,790
Costs:   $250 (AI/TTS/Storage)
Payten:  ~$400 (processing fees)
────────────────────────
Net:     $6,140/month
Margin:  90.4%
```
