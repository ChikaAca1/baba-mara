```

## Setup

### 1. Payten Account

Sign up for Payten account:
1. Visit https://payten.com (or regional equivalent)
2. Create merchant account
3. Complete KYC verification
4. Get API credentials:
   - API Key
   - Merchant ID

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
PAYTEN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
PAYTEN_MERCHANT_ID=your-merchant-id-here
PAYTEN_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox # or 'production'
```

### 3. Webhook Configuration

Configure webhook in Payten dashboard:
- **Webhook URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/payment/webhook`
- **Events**: `payment.completed`, `payment.failed`, `payment.refunded`
- **Method**: POST
- **Signature**: HMAC-SHA256 (using API key as secret)

**Important**: Use HTTPS in production for webhook security.

### 4. Test Mode

Use sandbox environment for testing:
- Set `PAYTEN_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox`
- Use Payten test cards
- Verify webhooks work locally with ngrok/localtunnel

## Components

### Core Payment Module (`lib/payten/client.ts`)

**Functions:**

**`createPayment(request: PaymentRequest)`**
- Creates payment session with Payten
- Returns payment URL for user redirect
- Handles API errors gracefully

**`verifyPayment(paymentId: string)`**
- Checks payment status with Payten
- Used for manual verification if webhook fails

**`verifyWebhookSignature(payload: string, signature: string)`**
- Validates webhook authenticity
- Uses HMAC-SHA256 with API key as secret
- Prevents webhook spoofing attacks

**`refundPayment(paymentId: string, amount?, reason?)`**
- Processes full or partial refunds
- Updates transaction status to 'refunded'
- Deducts credits from user account

**`PRICING` Configuration**:
```typescript
{
  single: { amount: 199, credits: 1, currency: 'USD' },
  subscription: { amount: 999, credits: 12, currency: 'USD', interval: 'month' },
  topup: { amount: 999, credits: 10, currency: 'USD' }
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### `POST /api/payment/create`

Create payment session.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentUrl": "https://payten.com/checkout/...",
  "transactionId": "uuid",
  "paymentId": "payten_payment_id"
}
```

**Flow:**
1. Authenticate user
2. Validate payment type
3. Create transaction record in database (status: pending)
4. Call Payten API to create payment
5. Return payment URL for redirect

#### `POST /api/payment/webhook`

}
```

**Processing:**
1. Verify webhook signature
2. Find transaction by order ID
3. Handle event based on type:
   - `payment.completed`: Add credits, update subscription
   - `payment.failed`: Mark transaction as failed

Already defined in `supabase/migrations/20250109_initial_schema.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'single', 'subscription', 'topup'
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD',
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded'
  payment_id TEXT, -- Payten payment ID
  payment_method TEXT, -- 'payten', etc.
  credits_purchased INTEGER NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  CONSTRAINT status_check CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded'))
);
```

### Database Functions

**`add_user_credits(p_user_id UUID, p_credits INTEGER)`**
- Adds credits to user account
- Used after successful payment

**`deduct_user_credits(p_user_id UUID, p_credits INTEGER)`**

## Pricing & Economics

### Product Pricing

| Product | Price | Credits | Cost per Credit | Savings |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Single Reading | $1.99 | 1 | $1.99 | - |
| Subscription | $9.99/mo | 12 | $0.83 | 58% |
| Top-Up Package | $9.99 | 10 | $1.00 | 50% |

### Cost Structure

**Per Reading Costs:**
```
AI Generation (Claude):  $0.020
TTS (OpenAI):            $0.004
LiveKit Voice (optional): $0.050
Storage:                 $0.001
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Text Reading:            $0.025
Voice Reading:           $0.075
```

**Profit Margins:**

| Product | Revenue | Cost (text) | Cost (voice) | Margin (text) | Margin (voice) |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Single | $1.99 | $0.025 | $0.075 | 98.7% | 96.2% |
| Subscription | $9.99 | $0.300 | $0.900 | 97.0% | 91.0% |
| Top-Up | $9.99 | $0.250 | $0.750 | 97.5% | 92.5% |

**Monthly Revenue Estimate (1,000 users):**
```
Scenario: 40% single, 30% subscription, 30% top-up

Revenue:
- Single: 400 Ã— $1.99 = $796
- Subscription: 300 Ã— $9.99 = $2,997
- Top-Up: 300 Ã— $9.99 = $2,997
TOTAL REVENUE: $6,790

Costs (assuming 50% text, 50% voice):
- Text readings: 2,500 Ã— $0.025 = $62.50
- Voice readings: 2,500 Ã— $0.075 = $187.50
TOTAL COSTS: $250

NET PROFIT: $6,540/month (96.3% margin)
```

### Payment Processing Fees

Payten typically charges:
- **Card payments**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Local payments**: 1.5% - 3.5% depending on method

**Example fees:**
- $1.99 transaction: $0.36 (18%)
- $9.99 transaction: $0.59 (5.9%)

**Adjusted margins:**
- Single: ~80%
- Subscription: ~91%
- Top-Up: ~92%

## Security

### Payment Security

- **PCI Compliance**: Payten handles all card data (we never store it)
- **HTTPS**: All payment pages and webhooks use HTTPS
- **Webhook Signature**: HMAC verification prevents spoofing
- **Server-side Validation**: All payment logic runs server-side
- **No Client Secrets**: API keys never exposed to client

### Fraud Prevention

- **User Authentication**: Must be logged in to purchase
- **Guest Prevention**: Guest accounts cannot purchase (must create permanent account)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent rapid repeat purchases
- **Transaction Logging**: All attempts logged to database
- **Error Logging**: Failed payments logged for analysis

### Database Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only see their own transactions
- **Prepared Statements**: All queries use parameterized statements
- **Service Role Key**: Sensitive operations use service role key
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history maintained

## Testing

### Test Payment Flow

1. **Create Account**: Sign up with test email
2. **Navigate to Payment**: `/payment` page
3. **Select Plan**: Click buy button
4. **Redirect to Payten**: Complete payment with test card
5. **Webhook Trigger**: Payten sends webhook (use ngrok for local testing)
6. **Credits Added**: Verify credits appear in dashboard
7. **Transaction History**: Check `/dashboard/transactions`

### Test Cards (Payten Sandbox)

- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Insufficient Funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995
- **Expired**: 4000 0000 0000 0069

Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVV.

### Local Webhook Testing

Use ngrok or localtunnel for webhook testing:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Start ngrok tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# Copy HTTPS URL and configure in Payten dashboard
https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/payment/webhook
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Payment creation failed"
- Verify `PAYTEN_API_KEY` and `PAYTEN_MERCHANT_ID` are set
- Check API key is valid for environment (sandbox/production)
- Inspect network tab for API response errors
- Check Payten dashboard for account status

### "Webhook not received"
- Verify webhook URL is configured in Payten dashboard
- Ensure webhook URL is publicly accessible (use ngrok for local)
- Check webhook signature verification
- Review Payten webhook logs in dashboard
- Check your server logs for webhook receipt

### "Credits not added after payment"
- Check transaction status in database (`transactions` table)
- Verify webhook signature validation passed
- Check `add_user_credits` function executed successfully
- Review `error_logs` table for any errors
- Manually verify payment status with `/api/payment/verify`

### "Subscription not activated"
- Check `subscriptions` table for entry
- Verify `users.subscription_status` updated
- Check webhook handled `payment.completed` correctly
- Review database function execution logs
